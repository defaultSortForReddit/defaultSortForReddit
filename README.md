# defaultSortForReddit
Simple firefox and chrome extension to automatically sort home, subreddit, and user pages.  

This add-on will allow Reddit users to select which option they want to use to sort content when going to the home page, or individual subreddits. By default, it will sort to the "new" option. Designed to work with reddit.com, not old reddit.

If anyone is like me, you particularly hate how Reddit defaults the home page to "best" every time you load it. To combat this annoying behavior, I created a simple Firefox browser extension. The extension is available for Firefox on desktop as well as Android devices!

It's free and allows you to set your preferred sort method for both the home page as well as subreddits. All it does is monitor the web URL adjust it to match your sort preference.
